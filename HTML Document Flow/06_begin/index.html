        <h1>The Display Property</h1>
        <p>The <em>display property</em> allows you to change the default behavior of an element. You can use it to make an inline level element display like a block level element, or a block level element display like an inline level element.  You can even use it to hide elements completely as if they were never there.</p>
        
        <span>There is even the option to display an element like both.</span>
        <span>That's right.</span>
        <span>Inline-block displays like an inline level element, while accepting width and height values like a block level element.</span>
    </body>
